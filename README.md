# Object Detector
An object detector is a type of computer vision algorithm that is designed to detect and locate objects within an image or video. It uses machine learning techniques to identify specific objects or classes of objects within the image or video, and then draws a bounding box around them. Object detection algorithms can be based on various approaches, such as using deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or using traditional computer vision techniques like feature-based methods. Object detection has various applications such as self-driving cars, facial recognition, robotics, and video surveillance.
